      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, welcome to the new year! Let&amp;rsquo;s make this a year of consistency and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is January 6, 2026. I’ve been reading about creating to-do lists for yearly goals, and it has made me think about how vital it is to stay consistent in our actions. While I often read about the importance of setting &amp;ldquo;New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions,&amp;rdquo; I rarely see anyone talk about creating a to-do list for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that New Year’s Eve alone can change someone, or that you can achieve something just because you start with a burst of willpower. Instead, I believe that if you have a desire—for example, learning a new language—you should create a plan, strive for weekly consistency, and refuse to give up until you reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this year, I hope you believe in yourself more than in a number changing on the calendar. I hope you challenge yourself, make a plan, and actually follow it. I also hope you respect your limits without putting too much pressure on yourself; simply follow the plan and learn to enjoy the journey, not just the result. I guarantee that this mindset will change your life more than the passing years ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your schedule to organize your plan and try to respect the time blocks you’ve chosen, whether it’s 30 minutes or an hour. The most important thing is to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often much harder to stick to a long-term plan than it is to do a lot at the beginning and quit a week later. But the truth is, if you can stay consistent over time, you will see incredible changes. And of course, the real secret is this: if you love the process, nothing and no one can stop you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2026 and for the rest of your life, I wish you consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugs!&lt;/p&gt;
