      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, welcome to the new year! Let&amp;rsquo;s make this a year of consistency and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is January 6, 2026. I’ve been reading about creating to-do lists for yearly goals, and it has made me think about how vital it is to stay consistent in our actions. While I often read about the importance of setting &amp;ldquo;New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions,&amp;rdquo; I rarely see anyone talk about creating a to-do list for your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe that New Year’s Eve alone can change someone, or that you can achieve something just because you start with a burst of willpower. Instead, I believe that if you have a desire—for example, learning a new language—you should create a plan, strive for weekly consistency, and refuse to give up until you reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this year, I hope you believe in yourself more than in a number changing on the calendar. I hope you challenge yourself, make a plan, and actually follow it. I also hope you respect your limits without putting too much pressure on yourself; simply follow the plan and learn to enjoy the journey, not just the result. I guarantee that this mindset will change your life more than the passing years ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your schedule to organize your plan and try to respect the time blocks you’ve chosen, whether it’s 30 minutes or an hour. The most important thing is to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often much harder to stick to a long-term plan than it is to do a lot at the beginning and quit a week later. But the truth is, if you can stay consistent over time, you will see incredible changes. And of course, the real secret is this: if you love the process, nothing and no one can stop you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2026 and for the rest of your life, I wish you consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugs!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keep Studying Never Stop</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-suggest-you-never-stop-studying&#34;&gt;Why I suggest you never stop studying!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of my career, searching for a profession, I was always very curious about computers, but with a limited income, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to study, buy computers, or have access to technology in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first job was painting bicycle handlebars, and I had no prospects. Later, I got a job managing the inventory of a candy store. With that, I made an agreement with my family that the little money I earned would go towards paying for college, and we all agreed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting college, a friend recommended me for an infrastructure job (internship), and without a second thought, &lt;strong&gt;I said YES YES YES, I WANT IT&lt;/strong&gt;! In the interview, &lt;strong&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t truthful, FEARING I MIGHT LOSE THE ONLY CHANCE&lt;/strong&gt;, and when they asked if I had ever swapped hard drives in servers, I said YES, OF COURSE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was so simple, and I managed to do it without ever having done it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in college, I simply fell in love with writing code. I always completed the projects and tasks, sometimes without sleeping, but I got them done, and with an indescribable joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I have become a software engineer, and I continue learning new technologies as if it were my first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say, college helped my life in a way NOTHING else could have; it changed everything for the better! Sometimes I hear people say it’s not worth it, but I think the opposite—if you can or want to, do it without hesitation like I did in the past!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’d like to say, despite fears in this new world of GenAI and the challenges that come with it, &lt;strong&gt;never, NEVER stop studying&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you need help, any mentoring, I can try to help you, just reach out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugs, and keep moving forward with your studies!&lt;/p&gt;
