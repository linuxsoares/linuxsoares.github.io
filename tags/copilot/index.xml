      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m back from my vacation, and I’ve been thinking about writing about how we can use AI to help us with coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-a-break-and-recharge&#34;&gt;Take a Break and Recharge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I want to say this: take a moment in your life to rest. Go on vacation, visit the beach, the mountains,
the countryside, or the city—go wherever you like. But make sure to take time to recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;now-lets-talk-about-ai&#34;&gt;Now, Let&amp;rsquo;s Talk About AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek are great for assisting with coding, but we need to use them carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AI can help us write code, the generated code isn’t truly ours, and that can become a problem in the future.
If we don’t fully understand the code AI produces, debugging it later can be challenging. When an exception is thrown,
we need to know why it happened and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while AI tools are helpful, we must use them with caution.
We should know every line of code we write, understand its logic, and truly take ownership of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-advice-on-using-ai&#34;&gt;My Advice on Using AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use AI for any task you need—whether for pair programming, writing code, generating tests,
or creating documentation—but always make sure you understand what you’re writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post, I want to emphasize that AI is just a tool. The code that AI generates is still your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first post after my vacation and I hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing you a great day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
