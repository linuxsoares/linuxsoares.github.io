      <title>Going Against the Flow of the World</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my country, this week marks the start of &amp;ldquo;Black Week,&amp;rdquo; although the correct term is &amp;ldquo;Black Friday,&amp;rdquo;
traditionally a single day of discounts in stores. As you know,
I’m a software engineer, and this week I’ve noticed many courses on sale,
offering a variety of options for learning new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this time, I’ve been reflecting on these courses and the increasingly fast-paced world
we live in—a world where everyone feels the need to learn quickly and where courses
often promise accelerated learning. I’ve decided that, as a human being, I shouldn’t follow this path of speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, anyone who has gained deep knowledge in a subject has done so through
years of study and consistent practice. I believe this should remain the standard today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this post isn’t about avoiding buying courses or learning materials altogether.
Instead, it’s about embracing the process of learning gradually, a little every day, and resisting
the pressure to conform to the fast-paced trends of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I’d like to share my decision this Black Friday week:
I’ve decided not to buy any courses or materials that promise faster, easier,
or miraculous results. Instead, I’ll continue reading my books, sticking to the routine
I shared &lt;a href=&#34;https://linuxsoares.github.io/posts/remember-life-is-not-a-100-meter-race/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and focusing on learning slowly and deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you make the most of this week of discounts where you live and take the opportunity to plan ahead,
focusing on a path that considers the medium and long term and that this post inspires you to reflect on
your learning process and the path you’re taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugs! 🤗&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This Post Isn&#39;t About Technology</title>
      <link>/posts/this-post-isnt-about-technology/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-post-is-about-depth-of-knowledge&#34;&gt;This post is about depth of knowledge!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my blog, I added Google Analytics—not to track performance,
but because I was curious about how people engage with my posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, as I’ve been writing for this blog, I’ve observed an interesting trend.
People seem to gravitate toward “ready-made recipes” or practical guides.
For instance, when I wrote posts about studying Golang or how Exercism helps me learn,
they attracted little attention. Similarly, posts about LeetCode, study techniques,
or my personal schedule and life routines didn’t generate much traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I shared a step-by-step guide on using Swagger in a Golang API—essentially
a “recipe”—it became the most-viewed post in my blog’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/count_posts_view.png&#34; alt=&#34;Example image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above shows a visualization of my blog&amp;rsquo;s behavior over the past week. As we can see, the post about Swagger has received more than double the views of any other post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this, if I could share one piece of advice, it would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat your life as a long journey—a marathon, not a sprint. Organize your time,
study a little every day, and create a routine that helps you stay focused.
Aim for deep, meaningful learning, because acquiring deep knowledge is the best way to
secure a relatively stable future—free from fears and uncertainties, even about challenges like AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://linuxsoares.github.io/posts/remember-life-is-not-a-100-meter-race/&#34;&gt;In the post&lt;/a&gt; where I compare life to a
marathon rather than a 100-meter sprint, I share how my routine works in the hope of helping and
motivating you to organize your life and focus on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn’t meant as criticism—think of it as friendly advice!
As the poet says, “If advice were truly valuable, it would be sold, not given away.”
Yet, here I am, offering it freely in an effort to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this post and that it inspires or helps you in some way!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Remember Life Is Not a 100 Meter Race</title>
      <link>/posts/remember-life-is-not-a-100-meter-race/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my life, I’ve often liked something and used it every day until I got sick of it.
But now, I’ve started therapy, and one of the first things I’ve learned is how to use a calendar to organize my routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By organizing my routine, I realized that I need to plan everything in advance—whether it’s for the week, month, or year.
For example, in my current routine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I exercise for one hour every weekday.
I study English two days a week, for one hour each day.
I spend 30 minutes every day reading books outside of my profession, among other activities.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about organizing your week with clear goals is understanding that progress takes time.
I won’t learn English or Golang (a programming language) in a day or a week. However, by organizing my week, I can work toward these goals gradually and stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, I’ll show you how I organize my week. I hope it helps you organize yours too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/example-calendar.png&#34; alt=&#34;Example image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I’ve structured my schedule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I exercise every day of the week.
I read every day.
I study a new technology every day.
I work regularly and ensure I spend quality time with my daughter and family.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly hope this helps you organize your week. It has been a great tool for managing anxiety and developing a long-term mindset. After all, life is not a 100-meter race!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this helpful and that it inspires you to organize your week too.&lt;/p&gt;
