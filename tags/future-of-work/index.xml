      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first answer is, I DON’T KNOW! Bye-bye! (Just kidding! Keep reading, please! It was only a joke!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I saw the new Canvas feature from OpenAI, and I’m feeling two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m very excited about the evolution of AI and the new possibilities it can bring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m also a bit scared by the rapid advancement of AI and the potential changes it could bring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first point. I use AI daily to help me write code at work. But of course, I don’t just copy and paste the AI-generated code into my editor (I use Zed). Instead, I use AI to resolve my doubts and assist me when I need to write in programming languages I’m less experienced with. This is amazing—it’s like having a knowledgeable assistant right by my side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the second point. I have a daughter, and I’m worried about the future that AI might create for her. What will my profession look like in the medium and long term? Will I still have a job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only certainty I have is that no profession will be the same after the use of AI. Whether it will improve, worsen, or cease to exist, we do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these concerns, I believe the key is to keep learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies. We need to be prepared for the new challenges that lie ahead. AI is a tool that can help us create and complete tasks with greater speed and quality, but it’s up to us to continue improving our skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I said in another article, don&amp;rsquo;t stop studying, stay focused and studying!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? How do you feel about AI and the new possibilities it brings?&lt;/p&gt;
