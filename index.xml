      <title>How Am I Learning Golang</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my work, I’ve started using Golang. I’m aware of AI tools like ChatGPT, which can help me complete tasks more efficiently.
However, I really enjoy learning new technologies and am always open to new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I learned &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.com/&#34;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; by reading books and practicing them daily.
This time, I’m learning Golang using different approaches. I use Exercism to practice Golang, and now I’ll show you how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Senior Software Engineer</title>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;senior-software-engineers-impacting-business-growth-and-inspiring-teams&#34;&gt;Senior Software Engineers: Impacting Business Growth and Inspiring Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started as a Software Engineer, I skipped the internal steps because my initial experience in tech was with infrastructure, not programming. I transitioned into software engineering four years later, and when I finally worked as a Software Engineer, I was very fortunate. My coworkers were exceptional professionals who supported me at the beginning of my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Senior Software Engineer now, I strive every day to be like those mentors and positively impact the people I work with. Knowing the business you work in better than anyone else enables you to help those around you and be an outstanding professional wherever you go.
A phrase that I always remember to impact the people around me is, always be the senior you wish you had met when you were a junior. This phrase has helped me to be a better professional and to help others in their journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First Clojure Project</title>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;creating-our-first-clojure-project&#34;&gt;Creating Our First Clojure Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s continue with our tutorial. Today, I will explain how we can create a Clojure project. I decided to split this article into two parts: we will explain how to create a regular project and a web project, where we will create an API for some service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start by creating a regular project. It won&amp;rsquo;t be an API, a library, or anything like that. I just want to demonstrate how to create a project, explain its structure, and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m &lt;strong&gt;Gilmar Soares&lt;/strong&gt;, a seasoned software developer with over 12 years of experience in the industry. I specialize in languages like Scala, Java, Python, and Go, and have worked on a range of projects involving complex systems, functional programming, and scalable architectures. My expertise extends to tools like Elasticsearch, Google Spanner, Finagle, and various modern build and testing frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond coding, I am passionate about optimizing performance, solving problems efficiently, and helping teams deliver robust, high-quality software. I’ve also been exploring the intersection of technology with natural language processing, API development, and data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
